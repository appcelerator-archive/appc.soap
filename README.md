# appc.labs.soap

This is an Arrow connector to SOAP based Web Services.

# Installation

~~~
$ appc install connector/appc.labs.soap
~~~

# Usage

If you set `generateModelsFromSchema` and `modelAutogen` to true in your configuration, then Models and APIs will
be generated for you based on the WSDL you provide in your configuration.

But in order for these to work properly, you will need to write a `handleResponse`
method in the config. This special method handles SOAP responses, turning them in to
JavaScript objects or arrays for setting up the models or collections.

For example, a certain SOAP service for fetching current Stock prices...

	http://www.webservicex.com/stockquote.asmx?WSDL

... Might return a string of XML from an endpoint (simplified for brevity):

~~~
<StockQuotes>
	<Stock>
		<Symbol>AAPL</Symbol>
		<Last>121.89</Last>
		<Name>Apple Inc.</Name>
	</Stock>
</StockQuotes>
~~~
To make this more palatable, we need to write our handleResponse method to turn that to a plain JavaScript object:

~~~
handleResponse: function (result, next) {
	require('xml2js').parseString(result, {explicitArray: false}, next);
}
~~~

Now the connector will receive a nice JavaScript object, instead of the XML string it was given, which it can then
properly return from your endpoint.

~~~
{
	StockQuotes: {
		Stock: {
			Symbol: 'AAPL',
			Last: 121.89,
			Name: 'Apple Inc.'
		}
	}
}
~~~

You might ask yourself, "Gosh, that's a lot of work. Why do I have to do that? Why can't you do it for me?" Well, to be
fair, it's only 3 lines of code. And those 3 lines of code will vary drastically from SOAP server to SOAP server. The
connector does a fair bit of work to normalize the data, and infer fields based on that data, but it is up to you to get
it across the finish line.

You can also reference the connector in your model, if you want to explicitly dictate which fields to include:

~~~
var Account = Arrow.Model.extend('Account', {
    fields: {
        Name: { type: String, required: true, validator: /[a-zA-Z]{3,}/ }
    },
    connector: 'appc.labs.soap'
});
~~~
