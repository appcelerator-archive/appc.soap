# appc.labs.soap

This is an Arrow connector to SOAP based Web Services.

# Installation

~~~
$ appc install connector/appc.labs.soap --save
~~~

# Usage

Reference the connector in your model.

~~~
var Account = Arrow.Model.extend('Account', {
    fields: {
        Name: { type: String, required: true, validator: /[a-zA-Z]{3,}/ }
    },
    connector: 'appc.labs.soap'
});
~~~

If you want to map a specific model to a specific table, use metadata.
For example, to map the `account` model to the table `accounts`, set it such as:

~~~
var Account = Arrow.Model.extend('account', {
    fields: {
        Name: { type: String, required: false, validator: /[a-zA-Z]{3,}/ }
    },
    connector: 'appc.labs.soap',
    metadata: {
        'appc.labs.soap': {
            table: 'accounts'
        }
    }
});
~~~
